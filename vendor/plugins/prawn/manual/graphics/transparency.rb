# Although the name of the method is <code>transparency</code>, what we are
# actually setting is the opacity for fill and stroke. So 0 means completely
# transparent and 1.0 means completely opaque
#
# You may call it providing one or two values. The first value sets fill opacity
# and the second value sets stroke opacity. If the second value is omitted fill
# and stroke will have the same opacity.
